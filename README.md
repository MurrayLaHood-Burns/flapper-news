Flapper news is a reddit like site created by following the MEAN stack tutorial by thinkster.io (https://thinkster.io/tutorials/mean-stack).

By following the tutorial and creating this website I learned:
* The fundamentals of routing and middleware on an express server
* Usage of MongoDB through the mongo console and mongoose javascript
* Angularjs software patterns such as factories, controllers, and views
* Frontend development using bootstrap and ejs
* Usage of the node package manager (npm) to download and use nodejs modules
